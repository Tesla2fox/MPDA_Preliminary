MPDA_Preliminary


## this  project is the preliminaries for the MPDA problem

# some problem to solve

1. try to complete the decode process of the MPDA problem in a week.
2. why choose the method of recalculation
3. why do not choose the method of saving all states
4. the decode method of `no-backtracking` should be written. And compare it with the method of decoding with the backtracking.
4. evaluate the time of decoding process
5. write constructive Method for the MPDA
6. the k-means cluster
7. the

# Some Progress 
1. On sep 5th, the decode process has been completed preliminarily.
2. On sep 6th, the decode process has been completed.
3.

# comparison 
1. The mehod of backtracking  and the method of `no-backtracking`
2. The liner problem and the no-liner problem 
3. no-liner contains the exponential problem and the other problem. such as ??
4. `Estimation distribution algorithm` and the constructive method
5. the `distributed` MPDA method
