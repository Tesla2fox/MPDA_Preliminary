MPDA_Preliminary


## this  project is the preliminaries for the MPDA problem

# some problem to solve

1. try to complete the decode process of the MPDA problem in a week.
2. why choose the method of recalculation
3. why do not choose the method of saving all states
4. the decode method of `no-backtracking` should be written. And compare it with the method of decoding with the backtracking.
4. evaluate the time of decoding process
5. write constructive Method for the MPDA
6. the k-means cluster
7. the Gauss can not fit the data 06[
8. the performance of `Gauss EDA method` is terrible
9. the LKH problem
10. Neighborhood insertion search
11. Neighborhood permutation search
12. BAH: add job to the end of sequence 
13. BIH: insert in the sequence
14. TRIPS: triplet append {from paper `New heuristics for the no-wait flowshop with sequence-dependent setup times problem`}
15. The benchmark can be constructed by the method of paper `New Benchmark Instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem`, which has been completed.
16. When a task point has been completed, the task point's index in other permutations should be deleted.
17. Draw some  gantt picture
18. In constructive method, the forecast calculation can be optimized.
19. The information of  the forecast calculation process can be used in  the real process.
20. In the constructive method, every robot should be allocated for task.
21. In the constructive method, robots should not go to a task point which has been completed.
22. The constructive method should avoid the situations which all robots are stuck
23. The two makespans are not equal. And there are some bugs in the delete progress.
24. The `sortPrePeiod` function can be optimized. Every time only update a part of `onRoad or onTask` dict.
25. How to select a robot to complete an unable task? 1.maybe  can use the bias to measure

# Some Progress 
1. On sep 5th, the decode process has been completed preliminarily.
2. On sep 6th, the decode process has been completed.
3. On sep 7th, the Gauss EDA has been completed preliminarily.
4. On sep 19th, three decode methods have been completed.	
	>- decdoe with the re-calculation
	>- decode with saving states
 	>- decode with no-backtrack
5. The decode method will chosse the decode method with saving states, on sep 20 th.
6.

# comparison 
1. The mehod of backtracking  and the method of `no-backtracking`
2. The liner problem and the no-liner problem 
3. no-liner contains the exponential problem and the other problem. such as ??
4. `Estimation distribution algorithm` and the constructive method
5. the `distributed` MPDA method
